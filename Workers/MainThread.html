<!-- Notes:

"Worker Thread"
1. Web workers in javascript run js in a sperate thread. 
2. They are in web level and not js level 
3. Prevent UI freezing
4. Enables parallel execution
5. Limitation are it cannot access DOM or window objects directly
6. Uses postmessage and onmessage as event listeners
